Dear [Parent/Carer Name],

RE: Level 3 Final Warning Contract – [Student Name]

I am writing to inform you that [Student Name] has reached Level 3 (Final Warning) of Evolution Education's Behaviour Framework. This is the most serious stage and requires immediate attention.

Why has this contract been issued?
[Student Name] has been escalated to Level 3 following [brief reason – e.g., "unsuccessful completion of Level 2" or "a serious breach of health, safety, or safeguarding expectations"].

This is a FINAL WARNING. This means:
• This is the last stage before potential termination of placement
• Failure to meet the conditions may result in referral to the CEO and termination of placement
• The student must demonstrate immediate and sustained improvement
• All expectations are non-negotiable

What support will be provided?
• Daily check-in/check-out with SLT or Pathway Lead
• Enhanced SEMH monitoring and targeted mentoring
• Weekly case review with you and the parent school
• Risk assessment reviewed and updated weekly
• All incidents recorded and reviewed daily

What we need from you:
• Immediate support and reinforcement of expectations at home
• Attendance at all review meetings
• Open and honest communication about any concerns
• Understanding of the seriousness of this stage

Potential outcomes:
• Successful completion: contract lifted, return to Level 2 or full reintegration
• Extension: further 4-week period with revised support
• Referral to CEO: if insufficient improvement, leading to possible termination of placement or temporary remote learning

Next steps:
We have arranged an urgent meeting with the parent school. You will receive a copy of the signed contract once it is finalised, and this will be uploaded to Bromcom.

This is a critical time for [Student Name]. We need to work together to ensure they understand the seriousness of this situation and support them to make the necessary changes.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately on [Contact Number] or [Email Address].
